## Planter's Punch

A tangy punch which harnesses the rich flavours of the rum.

Serve in a Collins glass
Garnish: Orange slice & mint sprig
How to make: SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass.

* 3 part	Pot still Jamaican rum
* 2 part	Freshly squeezed lime juice
* 1 part	Giffard Sugar Cane Syrup
* 3 dash	Angostura or other aromatic bitters
* 4 part	Chilled water

About: Invented in the late 19th century by the founder of Myers's rum, Fred L. Myers. The recipe on the back of each bottle of his rum is known as the "Old Plantation formula" and uses the classic rum punch proportions: 1 sour (lime), 2 sweet (sugar), 3 strong (rum) and 4 weak (water). Rather than this, or the American formula: 1 sour, 2 sweet, 3 weak, and 4 strong, I've followed David A. Embury's recommendation (in The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks) of 1 sweet, 2 sour, 3 strong and 4 weak.

## Tiki 421

(Trader Sam's Grog Grotto)

https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/tpjiy2/tiki_421_trader_sams_grog_grotto/

After learning of this tiki cocktail at Trader Sam's, I knew I had to work out the recipe. With a little help from the inside on my last trip, I was able to put together what I am confident is the recipe that they use. May the force be with you!

- 2 oz  Rumchata 
- 1/4 oz Amaretto 
- 2 oz Pineapple Juice 
- 3 oz Coconut Cream (Coco Lopez, blended, preferred) 

Shake with ice cubes, strain into your favorite tiki mug with about 8 oz of crushed ice.
Splash (1/4 oz)  Gosling's Black Seal Rum to finish and garnish with pineapple slice.

I tried Coco Real, but it was a bit gritty and too sweet, in my opinion. I think they actually use that at Disney, also blended, but the bartender recommended to run Coco Lopez through the blender until creamy.

The name is a play on the name of the stormtrooper that went missing in A New Hope, in case you didn't catch the joke.

## English Milk Punch

https://www.blossomtostem.net/clarified-milk-punch/


### Ingredients

    2 lemons, zest and juice
    1 orange, zest and juice
    1/2 pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch cubes
    1 cup sugar
    3 whole cloves
    10 coriander seeds
    1 cinnamon stick
    1 whole star anise
    1/2 cup brewed green tea
    2 cups boiling water
    1/2 cup cognac
    1/2 cup white rum
    1/2 cup aged dark rum
    1/2 cup Smith & Cross
    1/3 cup Batavia Arrack
    2 cups whole milk

### Instructions

    Add the lemon zest and juice, orange zest and juice, pineapple, sugar, and spices to a large mixing bowl (one with a spout is ideal) and muddle the sugar and fruit together. Add the green tea and boiling water and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the spirits and mix together. 
    In a separate large mixing bowl, add the whole milk. Then pour the punch mixture into the milk and stir. The mixture will curdle. Let sit for about 30 minutes and strain through a fine mesh sieve lined with a coffee filter
 or cheese cloth. There will still be some cloudy solids after the first straining. Pass the mixture through the same lined sieve again (the curds do much of the straining work). At this point it should be almost entirely clear. If any cloudy bits remain, strain one more time. Transfer to bottles or jars and store in the refrigerator.
    Pour about 1/2 cup into a glass with ice. You can garnish with a lemon peel or a grating of fresh nutmeg if you like.

### Notes

Keeps refrigerated for months.
