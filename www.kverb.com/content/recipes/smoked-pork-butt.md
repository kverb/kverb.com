How to cook a pork butt using a traeger pellet grill

## overview

This recipe yields a somewhat classic "pulled pork" that is cooked low and slow, then basted at a higher temp.
The time and temperature help break down the collagen resulting in very tender and juicy meat.
The flavor is very savory, smoky, and fatty. 
We like to eat this in tacos, but I imagine a BBQ sauce and bun would go well with this pork. 
This is a time commitment.
The dry brine should be done 12 hours in advance of the cook, and the cook time will likely take about 8 or 9 hours in total.

The high-level steps are: 

- dry brine overnight
- mustard bind, dry rub
- smoke at 220°F until pork reaches 160°F
- cover and baste in a roasting pan with basting liquid at 310°F until pork reaches 195°F.
- uncover and grill again to crisp up the bark. 

## ingredients

### the meat

- 6-9 pound pork butt, bone-in. Pork shoulder and pork butt (aka boston butt) are slightly different cuts; both are from the top of the front legs (shoulder area) of the hog.

### the seasonings

- Hardcore carnivore Red. I think any paprika-based bbq rub will do. They all have slightly different ratios of salt, pepper, garlic, but given the hap-hazard nature of applying the seasonig, i don't think it matters much. But a paprika-based rub gives a great red color.
- kosher salt (for dry brining)
- yellow mustard

For spritzing: 

- apple cider vinegar (about 2-4 oz)
- your favorite beer (about 2-4 oz)

### basting 

- fresh orange juice (about 1 cup)
- chicken stock (about 2 cups)
- peeled garlic cloves (at least 5)
- **have not tried, but,** i think 2 quartered yellow onions would be a great addition

### tools

- pellet grill (ideally with built-in temperature probe)
- instant probe thermometer (such as the lavatools javelin pro)
- silicone grill gloves (or something to help grab the hot butt and roasting pan while in the grill)
- large sheet pan
- large cooling rack that fits in the sheet pan
- boning knife
- large cutting board
- sterile glove (vinyl/nitrile/latex)
- 8+ oz spray bottle
- aluminum roasting pan (disposable kind)
- aluminum foil

## instructions

The night before the cook (12-24 hours ahead of time), the pork butt should be trimmed and dry-brined.

### trimming

- boning knife
- cutting board
- sterile glove

Set the pork butt on a large cutting board.
You will notice that the pork butt has a somewhat tapered shape, with the bone visible on the larger side.
One side will be mostly covered in a layer of fatty tissue (which we'll refer to as the bottom of the butt throughout this post).
Some trimming of the fatty tissue (on both the bottom and top) will be necessary; the amount and area will depend on the animal and the butchering.
I don't think a thick layer of fat on the bottom has any advantage here, although I've heard keeping it on and catching the rendered fat can be useful. 

Wear a glove on your non-dominant hand, and with a boning knife in your dominant hand, cut into the fatty areas, pulling the fatty tissue up with your gloved hand. 
A boning knife should allow you to use a sawing motion or a single slice as necessary.
Some butts may have remnants of blood vessels or similar tissue; cut those away and discard. 
I think the ideal end-state is a bottom side that has a fairly even and thin fatty tissue layer.
The top side should be free of any most fatty tissue, and somewhat even in texture and shape.
When looking at the top of the butt, near the bone, there will be two muscle sections that meet and form a narrow void and flap.
Cut away as much fat as you can from here; this cavity is a great area to heavily salt for the dry brine. 
Don't overthink it - most of the fat will just melt away during cooking. 

### dry brining

- sheet pan
- cooling rack
- paper towels
- salt

Keep your hand gloved. 
Place a cooling rack in a sheet pan.
Transfer the pork butt to the rack.
Pat all sides of the butt dry with paper towels.
Liberally salt all sides of the pork butt, using your gloved hand to maneuver the butt. 
Be sure to get salt into the cavity/flap near the bone on the top side.
Let rest in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours. 

### seasoning

- hardcore carnivore red seasoning
- yellow mustard
- sterile glove

Remove the butt from the refrigerator.
Start the pellet grill, set it for 220°F.
Flip the butt to the bottom (fatty) side.
Wearing a sterile glove, coat the bottom of the butt in yellow mustard.
The meat should be only barely visible. 
Make it rain with the red seasoning.
The end result should be very little mustard visible, and mostly the seasoning. 
Flip the butt and repeat for the top and sides. 
Let the meat rest for 15 minutes while the grill stablizes its temperature.

### initial cooking

Place the butt directly on the grill.
There are dichotomous opinions on cooking fat-side up vs down.
Experiment! but I recommend trying fat-side down to start.
Make sure you have a drip tray liner or foil to handle the fat that *will* definitely melt off the bottom.
Insert your temp probe if you have one. Aim for the most middle part of the butt - going through the cavity/flap on the top side is the easiest way.
The intial cook to 160°F will take around 5 hours for an 8-ish pound butt.
The pork will generally have a difficult time exceeding 160°F at this grill temp.

#### spritzing

- spray bottle
- apple cider vinegar
- beer

It is recommended that you do not spritz until the seasoning has 'set'; i.e., if you touch the outside of the butt, no seasoning rubs off. 
I've never quite gotten the seasoning to that state.
I think around 2 or 3 hours is a fine time to apply the first spritz.

The spritz is simply 1:1 apple cider vinegar and beer in a spray. I use modelo especial, but use whatever you have or prefer.

Note: avoid using a spritz that has visible solids, such as pulp from a juice, as this can clog the spray nozzle.
Consider instead a "mop sauce". I've never tried it, but a good friend of mine recommends a tequila and lime based mop. 

Spritz the butt every 30 or so minutes until the butt temperature reaches 195°F.

### basting

- aluminum foil roasting pan
- alumninum foil
- silicone grill gloves
- orange juice
- chicken stock
- garlic cloves

Once the butt reaches 200°F, transfer it to a roasting pan.
You might want to use grill gloves.
Add enough orange juice and chicken stock (in a 1:2 ratio) to cover about a 3/4 inch of the pan, maybe a little less.
Add the garlic cloves.
Cover the pan in aluminum foil.
Try to get it tightly covered with minimal gaps.

Increase the grill temp to 310°F. 
Cook until the butt temp reaches 195°F.

The basting will make the butt tender and juicy, but it will also lose the crusty bark that was formed during the spritzing step.

### re-barking

Once the butt reaches 195°F, decrease the grill temp to its lowest setting and open the lid. 
Unwrap the pan and remove the temp probe.
Transfer the butt back on to the grill grates. 
The butt should be very "jiggly" and care should be taken when transferring. 
It should appear moist and shiny on the outside.
Continue to leave the grill lid open until the grill reaches a temp below 200°F. 
Close the lid and set the grill temp to 220°F.

Continue cooking until desired "barkness" is set. I don't think this should take more than 30 minutes. 

The jus from the pan should be ...  really, really tasty. Save this and use it for reheating the pork, as a soup base, or poaching liquid.

Rest the pork butt on a sheet pan or cutting board for some amount of time.
I honestly have no idea how long but I'm guessing the longer, the better.
