This is mostly targeted for people visiting. 
In general, you'll want to stay south of Girard Ave, and when south of South street, you'll likely be in a few neighborhoods like Passyunk Square and Queen Village.

[This List on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yet6RF1dRSQrPtdi9) is mostly up-to-date.

## By neighborhood

### Center City

[Center City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_City,_Philadelphia) is broadly the "central business district" of Philadelphia and includes many of the main attractions, landmarks, and site-seeing destinations of Phila.
It also includes a few neighborhoods worth spending your time in, such as Rittenhouse Square, Washington Square, Old City, and Society Hill. There's also a historic China Town not far from the Reading Terminal. 

### Northern Liberties / Fishtown

North-east of center city, near the Delaware River side of Philadelphia are two hip neighborhoods that have undergone gentrification over the last 10+ years. 
As a result, they contain a bevy of interesting food and beverage spots.

## Food and Bev

Just use the saved places on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yet6RF1dRSQrPtdi9).

In no particular order, my favorites are:

- Friday, Saturday, Sunday (the upstairs restaurant is tasting menu only, but the downstairs bar is first come and has great food and cocktails. No beer.)
- Pretty much any of the Solemonov / Cook restaurants are excellent. 
- Starr restaurants are solid.
- Monk's cafe has a good burger, moules frites, and lots of unique beers, including Pliny the younger (seasonal).  
- All the great sandwich spots. Middle Child, Huda, High street, and pretty much any place that has hoagies.
- Cheesesteaks are plentiful, but check out the roast pork sandwich from DiNic's. 
- Originally from Brooklyn, but Paulie Gee's pizza is excellent. 


## random shit to be on the lookout for

- "Milk Jawn" ice cream. Sometimes pops up at a farmers market. It's really good. The retail location is in NoLibs or fishtown, i forget.
- In nice weather, there is a roving brass band called "Snack Time" that plays delicious funk while roaming the streets and parks.
- "Go birds" is the local shibboleth for all salutations. It's used like "Hello".
- "Water" is pronounced like "wooder". Not joking.
